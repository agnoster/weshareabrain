# We Share A Brain

> Status: Defunct.

A simple todo manager for my wife and me. One of my first Rails projects. (2.3!)

I decided to fight entropy for practice and shiggles, and make the project run out of the box again.

* Gemfile for Bundler
* Use sqlite in dev
* Procfile for Foreman
* Makefile to bootstrap

# how to run it

    make setup # install deps from bundler, set up DB
    make run # -> foreman start
